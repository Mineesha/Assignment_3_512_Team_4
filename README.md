This project enhances the CLASS 8 microservice demo by replacing hardcoded data in the 'orderService', 'productService', and 'userService' microservices with a MongoDB backend. The 'clientService' remains largely unchanged, focusing on consuming data from these services. 

Technologies used: Python 3, Flask, MongoDB, and pymongo.
